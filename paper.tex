\section{Introduction}

The convergence of artificial intelligence and cryptographic systems has opened new frontiers in privacy-preserving computation and verifiable AI operations. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and handle sensitive data, the need for cryptographic proof systems that can verify computational integrity without revealing private inputs has become paramount. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) offer a compelling solution by enabling the verification of computations while maintaining data privacy~\cite{goldwasser1985knowledge}.

Recent developments in zero-knowledge virtual machines, particularly RISC Zero's zkVM~\cite{risc0whitepaper}, have made it practical to generate proofs for arbitrary computations. However, integrating these powerful cryptographic primitives with AI applications remains challenging due to the complexity of proof generation systems and the lack of standardized interfaces for AI-tool interaction.

The introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic~\cite{anthropic2024mcp} has provided a standardized framework for AI applications to interact with external tools and data sources. MCP enables seamless communication between AI models and external systems through a unified protocol, breaking down integration barriers and facilitating interoperability across diverse platforms.

This paper presents RISC Zero MCP, a comprehensive system that bridges zero-knowledge proof generation and AI tool integration through the Model Context Protocol. Our contributions are threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We design and implement a complete MCP server architecture that exposes RISC Zero zkVM capabilities as standardized AI tools, enabling AI agents to generate cryptographic proofs for various mathematical operations.

\item We develop a binary proof storage system that optimizes performance and compatibility, reducing storage overhead by approximately 50\% compared to traditional hexadecimal encoding while maintaining full verification capabilities.

\item We provide a comprehensive security analysis and evaluation of the system, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios and identifying key considerations for deploying ZKP-enabled AI tools.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:background} provides background on zero-knowledge proofs and the Model Context Protocol. Section~\ref{sec:architecture} details our system architecture and design decisions. Section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes the implementation details and technical innovations. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} presents our experimental evaluation and performance analysis. Section~\ref{sec:security} discusses security considerations and threat analysis. Section~\ref{sec:related} reviews related work, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with future directions.

\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Proofs and RISC Zero}

Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself~\cite{goldwasser1985knowledge}. RISC Zero's zkVM implements a STARK-based proof system that can generate proofs for arbitrary RISC-V programs, making it particularly suitable for complex computational tasks.

The RISC Zero architecture consists of three main components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Guest Programs}: RISC-V executables that perform the computation to be verified
\item \textbf{Host Environment}: The execution environment that runs guest programs and generates proofs  
\item \textbf{Verification System}: Components that validate the generated proofs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Context Protocol}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI applications interact with external tools and data sources. MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{MCP Clients}: AI applications that consume external capabilities
\item \textbf{MCP Servers}: Services that expose tools, resources, and prompts to clients
\item \textbf{Transport Layer}: Communication infrastructure enabling bidirectional data exchange
\end{itemize}

MCP servers provide three types of capabilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Tools}: Enable external operations and API invocations
\item \textbf{Resources}: Expose structured and unstructured data
\item \textbf{Prompts}: Provide reusable templates for workflow optimization
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Motivation}

The integration of zero-knowledge proofs with AI workflows addresses several critical challenges:

\textbf{Privacy-Preserving Computation}: AI agents often process sensitive data that should not be exposed during computation verification. ZKPs enable verification of computational correctness while maintaining input privacy.

\textbf{Trustless Verification}: In multi-agent systems or cross-organizational workflows, participants need to verify that computations were performed correctly without trusting the computing party.

\textbf{Regulatory Compliance}: Industries with strict privacy requirements can benefit from verifiable computations that don't expose regulated data.

\textbf{Computational Integrity}: AI agents making critical decisions can provide cryptographic proof that their computations were performed correctly.

However, existing solutions suffer from integration complexity, requiring deep expertise in both cryptographic systems and AI application development. Our RISC Zero MCP system addresses these challenges by providing a standardized, easy-to-use interface for AI applications to leverage zero-knowledge proofs.

    env::commit(&a);
    env::commit(&b);

\textbf{Computation Privacy}: Intermediate computation steps are not exposed in proof artifacts.

\textbf{Result Privacy}: While computation results are typically public, the proof generation process doesn't expose unnecessary intermediate values.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems}

Several ZKP systems have been developed for different use cases. Zcash~\cite{zcash} pioneered practical applications of zero-knowledge proofs in cryptocurrency. More recent systems like Circom~\cite{circom} and Cairo~\cite{cairo} provide domain-specific languages for ZKP development. RISC Zero distinguishes itself by supporting arbitrary RISC-V programs, providing greater flexibility than constraint-based systems.

\subsection{AI Tool Integration}

The landscape of AI tool integration has evolved rapidly. LangChain~\cite{langchain} and LlamaIndex~\cite{llamaindex} provide frameworks for connecting AI models with external tools, but lack standardized protocols. OpenAI's function calling~\cite{openai_functions} introduced structured tool invocation, but remained platform-specific. MCP addresses these limitations by providing a universal protocol for AI-tool integration.

\subsection{Verifiable Computation}

Verifiable computation has been explored in various contexts. Pinocchio~\cite{pinocchio} provided early practical implementations, while more recent work like Bulletproofs~\cite{bulletproofs} has focused on specific applications like range proofs. Our work contributes by making verifiable computation accessible to AI applications through standardized interfaces.
